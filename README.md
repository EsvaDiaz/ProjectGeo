Energy Control System: comprehensive tool designed to manage and monitor electrical circuits in real time. This system combines a Database in MongoDB, a Backend developed in Node.js, a Frontend in React (Web App) and a Mobile App created with Flutter. Its main purpose is to facilitate the creation, editing, deletion and visualization of electrical circuits on an interactive map, showing their status (with or without power) according to a specific schedule. In addition, it has a synchronized clock that updates the status of the circuits in real time, providing an intuitive and efficient user experience.
